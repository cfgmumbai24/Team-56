# GramUrja Web Applications

## Overview

GramUrja, through its GramHunar and GoatMitra programs, aims to transform rural education and support livelihood initiatives. To facilitate these goals, we have developed two web applications that streamline data collection, reporting, and visualization.

## GramHunar Web Application

The GramHunar web application is designed to assist educational leaders in monitoring and reporting the progress of students. Teachers can log in and access detailed information on each student, including progress in three key areas:
- **Social-Emotional Score**
- **Literacy Score**
- **Numeracy Score**

### Key Features
- **Teacher Authorization**: Secure login for teachers to access and manage student data.
- **Student Progress Tracking**: Detailed view of individual student progress based on social-emotional development, literacy, and numeracy.
- **Class Data Visualization**: Teachers can view comprehensive visualizations of the entire class's performance as well as individual student performance.
- **Social-Emotional Assessment**: Based on a 10-question survey focusing on concentration and social behavior, providing a score that aids in tracking social-emotional development.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Visual representations of data help teachers make informed decisions and provide targeted support to students.

### How to start
 To start the frontend, clone the repo then install the node modules in npm i and to run the backend clone the repo, initialize the node modules by npm i and then run the backend using npm run dev 

## GoatMitra Web Application

The GoatMitra web application supports the livelihood program by providing a platform for managing data related to goat health and ownership.

### Key Features
- **Two-Way Gateway**: Separate portals for organizations and doctors.
  - **Doctor Portal**: Allows doctors to add monthly health reports for goats or view existing reports.
  - **Organization Portal**: Enables organizations to track the total number of goats, including those without homes, adults, and kids.
- **Health Report Management**: Doctors can record health metrics such as weight, height, vaccination status, disease presence, and reproductive history.
- **Organizational Insights**: Organizations can see detailed statistics on goat populations and health status, aiding in better management and support of the GoatMitra program.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building interactive user interfaces.
- **Axios**: For making API requests to fetch and manage data.
- **Node.js and Express**: For backend API services.
- **MySql**: As the database for storing application data.
